				<h2>Principal Message - TAS</h2>
					<p>We learn from Children the virtues of Purity, Patience and Perseverance which are the essentials of life. We should abide by the democracy of the children, for the children and by the children. Its’ my humble request to my lovable parents to spend quality time with their children, understand their inner feelings, let a vent to their emotions and encourage their innovations. Let our children learn the right path of life with moral values and prepare each one to be ideal ward, student, citizen, and a perfect human being.
					
					<p><h4 align="center">A big thanks to all with us !</h4>
					
					<h4><p>Sharmila Basu Roy
					<br>Principal</h4>
			
				<h2>Important Idea - TAS</h2>
					<p>Parents and community members are always welcome. The school teachers and the management are accessible and open to parent participation, recognize parents’ expertise and provide opportunities for their contributions. Effective communication and collaboration with parents and the community also promote better outcomes for students.
