					<h2>Community Outreach - TAS</h2>
					  <p>“Try not to be a man of success but rather try to be a man of value.”
					  <br><b>- Albert Einstein  </b>
					  <p>In this technologically advanced era where all the information is just a click away, the students are not short of sources of knowledge. But the aim of education is not only developing the mind of the children, the sole aim is the holistic development. Hence, we stress on value education as an integral part of our curriculum. Value based education imparts social, moral, integrity, character, spirituality and much more. It builds the qualities of humility, strength and honesty in a person. They become better citizens of a country. We aim to prepare empowered minds who take responsibility for their own learning.
					  
					  <p><h2>TAS aims to Build students’ social and emotional competencies</h2>
						<p>Social norms are often established and spread by members of the popular crowd, who tend to have a disproportionate influence on school climate. When popular students get good grades, the general sense of school attachment is strong, and more students emulate these leaders. If, however, the popular one favor fun over future, sports over studies or popularity over inclusiveness, they will undermine a positive learning environment. Because student leaders have a powerful impact on school culture, the educators/teachers pay close attention to the messages and attitudes conveyed from student to student. TAS strives to recruit those influential young people as allies in various leadership roles.
