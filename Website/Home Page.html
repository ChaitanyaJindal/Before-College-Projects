						<ul>
							<li>Quality education for all. The Adhyyan is a school for Humanity. Envisions a world where everyone has an open access to knowledge and actively benefits from quality education to create a better life for them.
							<li>Everyone should be allowed to share his or her voice, skills, and ideas with the world.

							<li>Age, gender, race, or religion cannot define individual or community learning or problem-solving capacity.

							<li>Learning isn’t confined to the classroom; it can happen anywhere, anytime.

							<li>Problem-solving is the function of education.

							<li>Asking the right questions is the bedrock of innovation.

				 <td><h3>School Counsellor</h3>“I’m lucky. My principal puts me out front in the morning to kind of be at the gate, so not only do I see the children coming in, I can see the ones who are in tears, just had a fight with mom or having a bad day because the dog died or something. I also see the new parents coming in and that’s my chance to get to meet them.”</td>
				 <td><h3>Parent</h3>“Academics are critical, obviously, and a great education is crucial, but fostering the other sides of the child—the social side and the communication side— builds life skills. It is the place of the family to take care of that to a large extent, but having that reinforced at school is a huge advantage.”</td>
				 <td><h3>Principal</h3>“We try to model in our relationships with one another, adult to adult, what we hope to see child to child. Our children set their own standards of behavior in the classroom, and we as a staff have set norms for our interactions with one another. We want the environment to be positive and healthy for the children—and it’s only going to be that way if it’s positive and healthy for the adults.”</td>
